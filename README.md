# Timer for Canoe Freestyle 
This is the timer software Canoe Freestyle competitions. The timer complies with ICF Canoe Freestyle Competition Rules 2019. 

Operation is very simple:
- Press a button to start the timer which is running from 45 seconds down to 0. Time is shown on LED dislay. Piezo buzzer provides audible signal that timer is running. 
- One tone is played 10 seconds before end. 
- Two tones are played in the end.
- Blinking "X" is played when the time has finished.
- The timer is ready for the new run immediately after finishing the time.

Software is running on Arduino Uno, which is connected to LED display, loud speaker and switch. The switch is used to start the timer. 
Time is outputted to serial port of the Arduino Uno, which enables addtional functionality outside of the Timer. 

Software uses DMD2 library, which provides functionality write text and numbers to LED Screen. This library is available from https://github.freetronics/DMD2. I have made own fonts that are more suitable for the timer display.
